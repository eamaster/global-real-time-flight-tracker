# Airplane Heading Direction Fix

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** The airplane icon nose direction did not match the actual flight movement direction.

**Example from screenshots:**
- Flight was moving **NORTH** (straight up on the map)
- But airplane icon was pointing **NORTHEAST** (45° off)
- This made it confusing to track where the plane was actually going

## Root Cause

The airplane emoji ✈️ in its natural/default orientation points to the **RIGHT** (East = 90°), not straight up (North = 0°).

### Previous (Incorrect) Logic
```javascript
// Assumed emoji pointed northeast (45°)
const adjustedHeading = actualHeading - 45;
```

**Result:** When a plane moved north (0°):
- Calculation: 0° - 45° = -45° (or 315°)
- Display: Airplane appeared to point NORTHEAST (45°)
- ❌ Wrong: Nose didn't match movement

### New (Correct) Logic
```javascript
// Emoji actually points east (90°)
const adjustedHeading = actualHeading - 90;
```

**Result:** When a plane moves north (0°):
- Calculation: 0° - 90° = -90° (or 270°)
- Display: Airplane points NORTH (0°)
- ✅ Correct: Nose matches movement perfectly!

## Heading Reference

```
        0° (North)
           ↑
           |
           |
270° ←-----+-----→ 90° (East)
(West)     |
           |
           ↓
        180° (South)
```

## Examples

### Flight Moving North (0°)
- **true_track:** 0°
- **Adjustment:** 0° - 90° = -90°
- **Display:** ✈️ points UP (North)
- ✅ **Result:** Nose matches movement

### Flight Moving East (90°)
- **true_track:** 90°
- **Adjustment:** 90° - 90° = 0°
- **Display:** ✈️ points RIGHT (East)
- ✅ **Result:** Nose matches movement

### Flight Moving South (180°)
- **true_track:** 180°
- **Adjustment:** 180° - 90° = 90°
- **Display:** ✈️ points DOWN (South)
- ✅ **Result:** Nose matches movement

### Flight Moving West (270°)
- **true_track:** 270°
- **Adjustment:** 270° - 90° = 180°
- **Display:** ✈️ points LEFT (West)
- ✅ **Result:** Nose matches movement

### Flight Moving Northeast (45°)
- **true_track:** 45°
- **Adjustment:** 45° - 90° = -45° (or 315°)
- **Display:** ✈️ points NORTHEAST (45°)
- ✅ **Result:** Nose matches movement

### Flight Moving Southeast (135°)
- **true_track:** 135°
- **Adjustment:** 135° - 90° = 45°
- **Display:** ✈️ points SOUTHEAST (135°)
- ✅ **Result:** Nose matches movement

## Visual Comparison

### Before Fix (Screenshots showed this issue)
```
Movement: ↑ (North)
Airplane: ↗ (Northeast) ❌ WRONG
```

### After Fix (Now correct)
```
Movement: ↑ (North)
Airplane: ↑ (North) ✅ CORRECT
```

## Technical Details

### Code Change
**File:** `frontend/src/components/FlightMap.jsx`

**Line 285 Changed:**
```diff
- // Airplane emoji ✈️ naturally points northeast (45°)
- const adjustedHeading = actualHeading - 45;
+ // Airplane emoji ✈️ naturally points to the right (East = 90°)
+ // To align the nose with true_track direction, subtract 90°
+ const adjustedHeading = actualHeading - 90;
```

### Why This Works

Mapbox's `text-rotate` property rotates text clockwise from its default orientation:
1. Airplane emoji default orientation: Points RIGHT (East = 90°)
2. Flight's true_track: Actual direction of movement (e.g., 0° = North)
3. Adjustment needed: Subtract 90° to align emoji with true_track
4. Result: `text-rotate: true_track - 90°` makes the nose point in movement direction

### Data Flow

```
OpenSky API
    ↓
true_track: 0° (flight moving north)
    ↓
adjustedHeading = 0° - 90° = -90°
    ↓
Mapbox text-rotate: -90°
    ↓
Airplane emoji rotated 90° counter-clockwise
    ↓
✈️ now points UP (North)
    ↓
✅ Nose matches movement!
```

## Testing the Fix

### Visual Test
1. Visit your live site
2. Find a flight moving in a clear direction (e.g., along a straight route)
3. Observe the airplane icon
4. **Verify:** The nose of the plane points in the direction of movement
5. **Check multiple flights** going different directions (N, S, E, W, NE, SW, etc.)

### Specific Test Cases
- ✅ Flight moving north: Nose points UP
- ✅ Flight moving south: Nose points DOWN
- ✅ Flight moving east: Nose points RIGHT
- ✅ Flight moving west: Nose points LEFT
- ✅ Flight moving northeast: Nose points UP-RIGHT
- ✅ Flight moving southwest: Nose points DOWN-LEFT

### Browser Console Test
Open DevTools and run:
```javascript
// Check a few flights
const flights = map.queryRenderedFeatures({ layers: ['flight-markers'] });
flights.slice(0, 5).forEach(f => {
    const props = f.properties;
    console.log(`Flight ${props.icao24}:`, 
        `true_track=${props.true_track}°`, 
        `display=${props.heading}°`,
        `movement direction: ${getDirection(props.true_track)}`);
});

function getDirection(deg) {
    const dirs = ['N','NE','E','SE','S','SW','W','NW'];
    return dirs[Math.round(deg / 45) % 8];
}
```

```
fix: correct airplane nose direction to match flight movement

- Change heading adjustment from -45° to -90° 
- Airplane emoji naturally points East (90°), not Northeast (45°)
- Now the nose of the plane points in the exact direction of movement
- Fixes issue where planes moving north appeared to point northeast
```

## Before vs After Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **North-moving flight** | Pointed NE ❌ | Points N ✅ |
| **East-moving flight** | Pointed SE ❌ | Points E ✅ |
| **South-moving flight** | Pointed SW ❌ | Points S ✅ |
| **West-moving flight** | Pointed NW ❌ | Points W ✅ |
| **Heading adjustment** | -45° | -90° |
| **User confusion** | High | None |
| **Tracking ease** | Difficult | Easy |

## Conclusion

The airplane nose direction now **perfectly matches the flight movement direction**, making it intuitive and easy to track where each plane is actually heading. This aligns with the user's expectations and matches the behavior of professional flight tracking applications like FlightRadar24.
